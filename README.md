# GavelScript VSCode Extension

This is a *very* basic VSCode extension to provide simple syntax highlighting for my scripting language [GavelScript](https://github.com/CPunch/GavelScript).

# Installation

after downloading the repo, move the extension to `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` and restart VSCode!

I'll add the extension to the VSCode Marketplace soon if you just want to wait until I upload it there :)
